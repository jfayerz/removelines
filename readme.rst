Remove Lines
============

A simple python3 utility to remove lines from a csv file.

A coworker had an annoying spreadsheet where every other line needed to be
removed.  So I made this.  It's simple but it did the job.

Note: For ease of use, the .csv file should be in the same folder as this .py file
